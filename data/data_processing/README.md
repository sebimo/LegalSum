The scripts were moved in this folder to tidy up the workspace. As this is not their original path (would be one level upwards),
it might be necessary to add one level of indirection ("..") to all the referenced paths.

As this move was done after the data processing + scraping and loading, I did not bother to clean them up. All the data from them is already obtained.
